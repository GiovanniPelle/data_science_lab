# My First Regression Pipeline Project and Scientific Report
This is my very first regression pipeline project and scientific report. This assignment was completed over two weeks for the "Data Science Lab" course (Master's degree in Data Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Torino).
For drafting the report, I heavily relied on ChatGPT 3.5 due to the tight time constraints. I acknowledge that it may contain errors and/or inaccuracies, but I choose to leave it as is to have a record of my starting point and strive for continuous improvement. 

The scratch code and report are open to everybody! 
Enjoy!
